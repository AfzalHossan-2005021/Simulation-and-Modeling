## Overview ✅

The task is to perform a simulation of a single-product inventory system for the objective of comparison of alternative ordering policies. The inventory is maintained by a company which would like to decide how many items it should have in inventory for each of the next n months, where n is a fixed input parameter.

## Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) 💡

The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a company's optimal or ideal order quantity that meets demand while minimizing its total costs related to ordering items, holding inventory, and shortage. A stationary ordering policy in the EOQ model can be used to determine the volume and frequency of orders, and it serves as a tool for management of inventory. The stationary ordering policy as well as various cost components associated with the single-product inventory system is described in the text book by Law in section 1.5.

## Input / Output files 🔧

The input and output should be text files as shown in the attached zip file.

### Description of the input file

- The **first line** contains 3 space-separated numbers: **I, M, P** denoting the Initial Inventory Level, Total Number of Months (the length of the simulation) and Number of Policies, respectively.

- The **next line** has 2 numbers: **D, beta_D**, as the Number of Demand Sizes and the Mean Inter-demand Time in months, respectively.

- The **next line** has 4 numbers: **K, i, h, pi**, as the Setup Cost and per-unit Incremental Cost, Holding Cost and Shortage Cost, respectively.

- The **next line** has 2 numbers: **min_lag, max_lag** as the Minimum delivery lag and Maximum delivery lag in months, respectively.

- The **next line** has **D** space-separated numbers specifying the cumulative distribution function of the Demand Sizes.

- The **next P lines** each have 2 space-separated numbers **s, S** denoting an ordering policy.
